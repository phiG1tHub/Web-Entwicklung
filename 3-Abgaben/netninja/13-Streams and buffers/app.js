// buffers and streams
// Buffers are a Temporary storage spot for a chunk of data
// that is being transferred from
// one place to another

// The buffer is filled with data, then passed along

// Transfer small chunks of data at a time

// data is passed on and processed  <------ Buffer <- [] - [] - []
// we can consume data when it has arrived

// With Streams we can transfer data and increase performance
